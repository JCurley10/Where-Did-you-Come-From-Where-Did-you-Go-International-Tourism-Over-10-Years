|Repo. organization and commit history |   3   | 0: No organization, 1 commit.<br> 1: Poor organization, 3+ commits.<br> 2: Ok organization, 3+ commits.<br>3: scripts in `src`, jupyter notebooks in `notebooks`, data, images, and other files similarly organized and 5+ commits.|
|Appropriate use of scripts/notebooks  |   3   | 0: Everything in a jupyter notebook.<br> 3: Perhaps some EDA presented in notebooks, but data acquisition, cleaning, and important analyses in scripts.|
|Object-oriented programming           |   3   | 0: You are repeating repeating yourself yourself.<br> 2: In functions.<br> 3: Appropriate use of classes|
|Code style                            |   3   | 0: It is difficult to understand what your code is doing and what variables signify. <br>2: Good variable/function/class names, `if __name__ == '__main__'` block, appropriate documentation.<br>  3: All previous and would perfectly pass a [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) test.|
|Coding effort (in scripts)            |   3   | 0: <= 50 lines of code.<br> 1: 51-100<br> 2: 101-150<br> 3: > 150     |

|Description of raw data               |   2   | 0: Mentioned in passing - no idea of what the features are, where it came from, how it was obtained.<br>  1: Just a few features, the source described in text (but no images of raw data.)<br> 2: Source described, walk through exemplary features and rows, appropriate tables/screenshots.|
|Exploratory Data Analysis             |   3   | 0: Who needs to understand the data, anyway? <br>1: Perfunctory - general pair-wise scatter matrix that says..what?<br> 2:  Documentation of interesting relationships between the features and target. <br>3: All previous and with thoughtful feature engineering.|
|Analysis (e.g cleaning pipeline, database creation, statistical tests) |   5   | 0: None<br> 1: Approach invalid/unsuited to problem.<br>  2: Brief description focused on results without any explanation of approach/method.<br> 3: Clearly explained process that my be slightly incomplete or with minor errors.<br>4: Clearly explained with no/few errors.<br> 5: Impressive effort.|
