Tourism can be regarded as a social, cultural and economic phenomenon related to the movement of people outside their usual place of residence. 
Tourism refers to the activity of visitors. 

A visitor is a traveller taking a trip to a main destination outside his/her usual environment, for less than a year, for any main purpose (business, leisure or other personal purpose) other than to be employed in the country or place visited. 

A tourist is a visitor if his/her trip includes an overnight stay; otherwise, a visitor is classified as a same-day visitor (or excursionist). 

Inbound tourism comprises the activities of a non-resident visitor within the country of reference.
